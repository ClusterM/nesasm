        -----
                - Predefined NES specific constants: PPU/APU registers

        
        v3.3  : Nov 1th, 2020
        -----
                - Output to stdout support (use '-' as output filename)
                - All messages redirected to stderr instead of stdout now
                - NES 2.0 support with very large files support, mappers up
                  to 4095, submappers, etc.
                - New directives for NES 2.0 header: .INESSUBMAP, .INESPRGRAM,
                  .INESPRGNVRAM, .INESCHRRAM, .INESCHRNVRAM, .INESBAT, .INESTIM
                - .INESPRG and .INESCHR can be used with actual size now, not
                  only number of banks, e.g. .INESPRG 8 and .INESPRG $20000
                  means the same now


        v3.0  : Aug 30th, 2018

        v2.51 : September 9th, 2000
        -----
                Assembler core :
                - added support for a new file format to the INCBIN directive,
                  INCBIN can now include '.fmp' map files created with the
                  mapper program Mappy.


        v2.50 : July 27th, 2000
        -----
                Assembler core :
                - fixed a few bugs here and there.
                - added a new predefined function SIZEOF that returns
                  the size of a data element (ex. included with #INCBIN)
                - added four experimental directives .proc/.endp,
                  and .procgroup/.endprocgroup; don't use them yet.


        v2.10 : January 22th, 1999
        -----
                Assembler core:
                - fixed a bug in backward branch code.
                - fixed a little bug in the expression parser.
                - merged the code of the NES and the PCE assembler, now
                  there's only one program.
                - made the code more portable; it can now be compiled
                  without any change on most Unix systems.
                - added '.byte' and '.word' directives (same as '.db' and
                  '.dw') for compatibility with other assemblers.
                - added a new command line switch, '-srec' to ouput a
                  Motorola S-record file (for EEPROM/EPROM programming).


        v2.01 : December 21th, 1998
        -----
                - minor update, fixed a litte bug in the bank code.
